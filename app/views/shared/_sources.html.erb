              <p>For the purpose of this study, “tree cover” was defined as all vegetation taller than 5 meters in height. “Tree cover” is the biophysical presence of trees and may take the form of natural forests or plantations existing over a range of canopy densities. “Loss” indicates the removal or mortality of tree canopy cover and can be due to a variety of factors, including mechanical harvesting, fire, disease, or storm damage. As such, “loss” does not equate to deforestation.</p>

              <p>When zoomed out, it appears that all tree cover loss occurs in 2001, but in reality loss happened gradually over the study period. As you zoom out, adjacent pixels representing loss—which may have occurred in different years—must be combined into a single pixel to remain visible on a larger scale. Authors of the study decided to display these “aggregate pixels” according to the year loss first occurred in any of the constituent pixels (often 2001 for low zoom levels with very large aggregate pixels). Zoom in for greater detail of when and where loss has occurred for individual 30 × 30 meter pixels.</p>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Overview</h3>
          <p>This data set measures areas of tree cover loss and tree cover gain across all global land (except Antarctica and other Arctic islands) at 30 × 30 meter resolution. Loss is presented annually (2000 through 2012), while gain is displayed as a 12-year cumulative layer. Loss and gain are displayed differently due to the underlying dynamics of tree cover loss (rapid) versus tree cover gain (slow).</p>

          <p>The data were generated using multispectral satellite imagery from the <a href='http://landsat.usgs.gov/science_L7_cpf.php' target='_blank'>Landsat 7 thematic mapper plus (ETM+)</a> sensor. Over 600,000 Landsat 7 images were compiled and analyzed using Google Earth Engine, a cloud platform for earth observation and data analysis. The clear land surface observations (30 × 30 meter pixels) in the satellite images were assembled chronologically and a supervised learning algorithm was then applied to identify per pixel tree cover loss or gain.</p>

          <p>Tree cover loss is defined as “stand replacement disturbance,” or the complete removal of tree cover canopy at the Landsat pixel scale. Tree cover loss may indicate a number of potential activities, such as timber harvesting, fires or disease, the conversion of natural forest to other land uses, or the crop rotations cycle of tree plantations. Tree cover gain was defined as the inverse of loss, or the establishment of tree canopy in an area that previously had no tree cover.</p>

              <p>Viewing data for the first period available via the time slider may include alerts that reflect detections from the February 2000 to December 2005 training period as the algorithm "catches up" post-training.</p>

              <p>The GFW team has clipped out some data in regions where data quality is suspected to be low because of persistent cloud cover over identified ecoregions. This covers parts of Liberia, Venezuela, Guyana, Vietnam, Laos, and Burma/Myanmar. The current extent of the FORMA alerts is available for viewing here—<a href='http://wri-01.cartodb.com/viz/3cc0f4c2-56d3-11e3-80bb-c8600054c0d1/embed_map?title=true&description=true&search=false&shareable=false&cartodb_logo=false&layer_selector=false&legends=false&scrollwheel=true&sublayer_options=1&sql=&zoom=3&center_lat=-1.845383988573187&center_lon=16.34765625' target='_blank'>FORMA geographic extent</a>.</p>

              <p>The <a href='https://github.com/wri/forma-clj' target='_blank'>algorithm</a> behind the FORMA alerts is constantly evolving to fix bugs and improve accuracy. As a result, what appears on the site and the results of analyses conducted on the site may change over time. It is important to always include the access date when citing FORMA. Analysis of FORMA alerts on the map should be considered definitive, as analysis is based on raw FORMA data, whereas the data on the map are optimized for visual display.

              <p>For the purpose of this study, “tree cover” was defined as areas with greater than 25% canopy cover (as determined by the <a href='http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1087-3562(2003)007%3C0001%3AGPTCAA%3E2.0.CO%3B2' target='_blank'>Vegetation Continuous Fields data set</a>), and change was measured without regard to forest land use. Tree cover assemblages that meet the 25% threshold include intact forests, plantations, and forest regrowth.</p>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Overview</h3>
          <p>FORMA is a near real-time tree cover loss alert system. It uses a cloud computing <a href="https://github.com/reddmetrics/forma-clj" target="_blank">algorithm</a> to analyze frequently updated satellite imagery along with complementary information on factors that affect tree cover loss, such as fires and precipitation. The system generates twice-monthly “alerts” for the world’s <a href="http://wolfweb.unr.edu/~ldyer/classes/396/olsonetal.pdf" target="_blank">humid tropical forests</a> that identify 500 × 500 meter areas where new, large-scale loss is likely to have occurred.</p>

          <p>FORMA is designed for quick identification of new areas of tree cover loss. The system analyzes data gathered daily by the <a href="http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/" target="_blank">MODIS</a> sensor, which operates on NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites. The FORMA alerts system then detects pronounced changes in vegetation cover over time, as measured by the <a href="http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/MeasuringVegetation/measuring_vegetation_2.php" target="_blank">Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)</a>, a measure of vegetation greenness. These pronounced changes in vegetation cover are likely to indicate forest being cleared, burned, or defoliated.</p>

          <p>FORMA alerts only appear in areas where the probability of tree cover loss is greater than or equal to 50%.</p>

          <p>Upcoming upgrades to FORMA include improving the resolution to 250 × 250 meters, and expanding coverage to tropical dry forest and eventually to other biomes across the global scale.</p>

        <div class='source_extended'>
          <h3 class='overview_title'>Methodology</h3>
          <p>This data set uses freely available satellite imagery, collected by the <a href='http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/' target='_blank'>Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)</a>, which operates on NASA's Terra and Aqua (EOS PM) satellite platforms and views the entire Earth’s surface every 1 to 2 days. The images help to reveal notable changes in vegetation cover over time using an indicator that measures vegetation intensity called the <a href='http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/MeasuringVegetation/measuring_vegetation_2.php' target='_blank'>Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)</a>. By applying an automated algorithm to this input and in combination with complementary data inputs for fire hotspots and global precipitation averages, areas where tree cover loss is likely to have occurred are therefore identified. The algorithm also employs parallel processing in a remote server system the cloud that enables the rapid analysis of these very large data sets.</p>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Explanation</h3>
          <p>Tree cover loss alerts appear when and where new, large-scale loss is likely to have occurred after 2005. Thus the alerts should not be interpreted as an analysis of total tree cover loss area but rather as an indication of an area that has a high probability of having experienced tree cover loss or disturbance over time. The system employs advanced statistical techniques to achieve the best fit to scientifically validate information on loss, measured as a probability. On the GFW website, alerts appear only for areas where there is a 50% or higher probability of tree cover loss. That is, alerts appear for a particular period when there has been significant loss in the area during or before that period.</p>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Temporal and spatial resolution</h3>
          <p>FORMA alerts are displayed on the GFW site as monthly data, and the site is updated each month. Users who download data for analysis will find that the underlying data set is actually available at 16-day intervals, intervals that do not line up perfectly with calendar months. Data is displayed at a monthly resolution on GFW due to the monthly availability of precipitation data input. Users can manipulate the GFW time slider to view trends in loss alerts from December 2005 to present.</p>

          <p>The alert system currently identifies 500 × 500 meter areas where loss is statistically likely to have occurred. Alerts for a 250-meter resolution version are currently being developed on Google’s Earth Engine platform and will be available in 2014.</p>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Geographic extent</h3>
          <p>FORMA alerts are currently available only for humid tropical forests (as defined by <a href='http://www.pnas.org/content/105/27/9439.full#ref-1' target='_blank'>Hansen et al. (2008)</a>, based on <a href='http://wolfweb.unr.edu/~ldyer/classes/396/olsonetal.pdf' target='_blank'>WWF’s terrestrial ecoregions</a>) spanning portions of 89 countries. The development team is working to incorporate additional data to extend the geographic coverage beyond the current extent. To visualize the geographic extent of the alerts on the map, switch on the “Humid Tropical Forest Biome” layer.</p>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Data applications</h3>
          <p>The alerts have been designed for quick identification of tree cover loss as it happens. This allows for rapid response and prioritization of scarce financial and human resources dedicated to forest conservation or sustainable forest management. Armed with this information, stakeholders can use preemptive methods such as on-the-ground visits or aerial inspection with high-resolution satellite imagery (less than 5-meter pixel resolution) to investigate suspected tree cover loss areas.</p>

          <p>In addition, the alerts may be of value to a variety of researchers who study both temporal and spatial patterns related to tree cover loss areas.</p>

          <p>Using the GFW platform, the alerts can be compared against other relevant data layers, such as protected areas and concessions boundaries, to evaluate the effectiveness of forest management practices across time and spatial extent.</p>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Accuracy and validation</h3>
          <p>Inaccuracies are an inherent part of remote sensing analysis. FORMA alerts appear in areas with a greater than 50% probability of tree cover loss, based on the algorithm described under Methodology. However, persistent cloud cover is a continuous issue in the tropics, and extreme flooding can also produce unreliable remotely sensed data that will result in tree cover loss “false positives” (alerts where no actual tree cover loss has occurred). Furthermore, the alerting system cannot detect all forest cover loss, whether due to the small size of the loss area, persistent cloud cover, or other explanations still being identified through GFW validation efforts.</p>

          <p>The major instances of false positives may occur as the following:</p>

          <ol class='bullets'>
            <li><strong>A random, "speckled" distribution of alerts across an ecoregion, or complete filling of a small ecoregion.</strong> Caused by limited or sparse training data, particularly in small ecoregions, which makes it difficult to tune the model there. As a result, alerts cannot be reliably detected. In a normal ecoregion, alerts are usually clustered.</li>

            <li><strong>A rapid explosion of alerts over 1-3 months covering a relatively large area.</strong> Caused by a significant, persistent drop in detected vegetation levels due to persistent cloud cover along coastlines, in mountains, or elsewhere.</li>

            <li><strong>Alerts in water.</strong> Caused by shifting water bodies. These alerts should be considered not necessarily as false positives but rather as ambiguous alerts requiring additional data for corroboration.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>The GFW team is working aggressively to address potential inaccuracies in the data through rigorous validation methods. Specifically, the GFW team is comparing the growing data set of historical alerts to other validated data sets, which are being used for similar applications.</p>

          <p><a href='http://www.wri.org/publication/satellite-based-forest-clearing-detection-brazilian-amazon' target='_blank'>This issue brief</a> demonstrates the spatial correlation of the alerts with the PRODES and DETER data sets, produced by the Brazilian Space Agency for the Amazon. The conclusions from the working paper help to illustrate the potential pitfalls of the algorithm, along with its strengths. Through future refinement and proposed crowdsourcing efforts, the GFW team expects the data quality of the FORMA Alerts will continue to improve.</p>

          <p>The Deforestation Alert System (Sistema de Alerta de Desmatamento—SAD) is a monthly alert that monitors forest cover loss and forest degradation in the Brazilian Amazon. The system generates information that is published monthly by <a href='http://www.imazon.org.br/' target='_blank'>Imazon</a>, a Brazilian NGO, through its <em>Forest Transparency Bulletin</em>. The monthly alerts are derived from a temporal mosaic of <a href='http://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/' target='_blank'>MODIS</a> daily images that are scaled down from 500 × 500 meter to 250 × 250 meter resolution. The monthly results are then validated using medium resolution images from the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (<a href='http://www.cbers.inpe.br/ingles/' target='_blank'>CBERS</a>) and NASA <a href='http://landsat.usgs.gov/' target='_blank'>Landsat</a> data in order to “ground-truth” the results being reported.</p>

          <p>The <a href='http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/casa/latest.html' target='_blank'>Quarterly Indicator of Cover Change (QUICC)</a> product was developed at the NASA Ames Research Center by the <a href='http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/sge/casa/' target='_blank'>CASA</a> ecosystem modeling team. QUICC compares the MODIS global vegetation index (VI) images at the exact same time period each year on a quarterly basis (end of March, June, September, and December) and identifies land areas that have lost at least 40% of their green vegetation from the previous product and over the past year. This level of green vegetation loss is commonly associated with major forest or tree cover loss.</p>

          <p>The CASA team updates the global QUICC products as soon as the newest quarterly MODIS worldwide VI image is produced. After September (Q3) 2012, the data were adjusted to exclude forest areas located >37 degrees north as a result of confusion caused by year-to-year variations in seasonal snow cover.</p>

              <p>Not all fires are detected. There are several reasons why MODIS may not have detected a certain fire. The fire may have started and ended between satellite overpasses. The fire may have been too small or too cool to be detected in the (approximately) 1 km<sup>2</sup> pixel. Cloud cover, heavy smoke, or tree canopy may completely obscure a fire.</p>
              <p>It is not recommended to use active fire locations to estimate burned area due to spatial and temporal sampling issues.</p>

          <p>The <a href='http://intactforests.org/' target='_blank'>Intact Forest Landscapes</a> (IFL) data set identifies unbroken expanses of natural ecosystems within the zone of forest extent, areas that show no signs of significant human activity and are large enough that all native biodiversity, including viable populations of wide-ranging species, could be maintained. To map IFL areas, a set of criteria was developed and designed to be globally applicable and easily replicable to allow for repeated assessments over time as well for verification. The criteria were separated into two groups to assess the spatial extent of developed areas and the fragmentation of these areas. These were then mapped and identified from <a href='http://landsat.usgs.gov/' target='_blank'>Landsat</a> satellite imagery for the year 2000. The landscapes identified as unfragmented were at least 50,000 hectares in size with a minimum width of 10 kilometers. This data can be used to assess forest intactness, alteration, and degradation at global and regional scales. </p>

            <dd>The forest above and below ground biomass were produced at 1 × 1 kilometer (100 ha) spatial resolution. The values for each pixel (1 × 1 km) refer to the biomass of forests remaining within the pixel and can be used directly to estimate total carbon stock in forests within one pixel. Along with the biomass values, there is an error map at the same spatial resolution providing the uncertainty in biomass estimation. It is recommended that both biomass and uncertainty values be used together for carbon assessments and verifications. The map will provide accurate estimates of total carbon stock and carbon density when aggregated to large areas (5,000-10,000 ha) for project and regional level assessments. The biomass value of a single pixel may have large uncertainty when compared with small plots for verification.</dd>

          <p>The Tropical Forest Carbon Stocks data layer shows a “benchmark” map of biomass carbon stocks for more than 2.5 billion hectares of forests on three continents, encompassing all tropical forests, for the early 2000s. Researchers from NASA’s <a href='http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)</a> and <a href='http://www.winrock.org/' target='_blank'>Winrock International</a> developed the layer by collecting data from more than 4,000 in situ inventory plots, plus optical and microwave imagery (1 km resolution) to extrapolate the amount of calculated carbon stocks from forests distributed over the South American, Southeast Asia, and the sub-Saharan African regions. Further data on tree height and landscape characteristics across the tropics were derived using satellite light detection and ranging (Lidar) data from the <a href='http://icesat.gsfc.nasa.gov/icesat/glas.php' target='_blank'>ICESAT GLAS Lidar</a>. This data set also helps illustrate regional patterns and provides methodologically comparable estimates of carbon stocks for 75 developing countries where previous assessments were either poor or incomplete.</p>

          <p>This data set indicates the location of intact and degraded primary forests across Indonesia as of the year 2000. Primary forest consist of mature natural forest cover that has not been completely cleared in recent history (30 years or more) and consisted of a contiguous block of 5 ha or more. Primary forest cover was mapped using Landsat composites and multi-temporal metrics as input data to a two-step supervised classification.</p>
          <p>The first step was a per-pixel classification of areas with tree canopy cover of 30% and above for the 2000 reference year. A second per-pixel classification procedure was performed to separate primary forest from other tree cover for 2000; contiguous areas of 5 ha and greater were retained as primary forest. A limited editing of this classification was performed to remove older plantations and adjust other forest formations that could not be identified using the per-pixel classifier, but could be identified in photo-interpretive contexts. Primary forests were subsequently characterized into primary intact and primary degraded subclasses using the GIS-based buffering approach of the Intact Forest Landscapes.</p>
          <p>To create the IFL layer, buffers of roads, settlements and other signs of human landscape alteration were used to identify degraded areas within zones of primary forest cover. IFL mapping employed 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2012 cloud-free Landsat mosaics to quantify changes in primary intact forest extent. Forest degradation is defined as an area having experienced a transition from primary intact forest to primary degraded forest and was estimated using IFL change for the 2000–2005, 2005–2010 and 2010–2012 epochs. The map of primary intact and primary degraded forest cover types corresponds to the Indonesia Ministry of Forestry’s primary and secondary forest cover types.</p>

          <p>“Logging concession” refers to an area allocated by a government for logging in a public forest. Logging concessions are distinct from wood fiber concessions, where plantation forests are established for the production of pulp and paper products. “Concession” is used as a general term for licenses, permits, or other contracts that confer rights to private companies to manage and extract timber from public forests; terminology varies at the national level, however, and includes "forest permits," "tenures," "licenses," and other terms.</p>

          <p>The logging concession data on GFW, while displayed as a single layer, is assembled on a country-by-country basis from multiple sources.</p>

          <p>Logging concession data displayed on the GFW website vary from country to country by date and data sources.

              <p>Logging in Cameroon’s forests is permitted within Forest Management Units (FMUs). This data set displays the FMUs within Cameroon’s permanent forest estate. Selective logging is permitted in Cameroon’s FMUs, which are further divided into logging concessions called annual allowable cuts (AACs). These logging permits require owners and operators to maintain permanent forest cover. This data set was produced in collaboration between the Cameroon Ministry of Forestry and Wildlife and WRI.

              <p>This data set provides the boundaries of forest areas licensed to companies for forestry and is a compilation of provincial forest tenure data sets across Canada. Tenures for Nova Scotia are not provided, due to changes underway in forest management in that province, and will be added to this data set when available. Much of Canada’s logging activity occurs on Crown (often referred to as “public”) land and is regulated by various provincial commercial forest tenure systems that allocate cutting rights to and confer obligations on recipients of the tenures. It is these tenure systems on Crown forest land that are the focus of this data product. The information in this data set was gathered in order to continue to develop an understanding of how much of Canada’s forest area is under commercial forest tenures, where these tenures (including the operating areas of major forest companies) are located, and who is most likely to control them. This information and these data sets are important because of the extent of tenures and the resulting logging activity over vast areas of Canada’s Crown forest land.</p>

              <p>The Liberia logging concessions data set combines the boundaries of forest management contracts, timber sale contracts, and private use permits, compiled by Global Witness from available government and contractual maps. Due to a lack of quality data, this data set should be used for demonstration purposes only and not for land use planning purposes. Forests in Liberia are managed by the state under the National Forestry Reform Law, enacted in October 2006. Following the enactment of this law, UN Security Council timber export sanctions against Liberia were lifted, permitting commercial forestry activities to resume. Forest management contracts include concession areas of 50,000 hectares to 400,000 hectares and are open for bids from qualified bidders that demonstrate at least 51% ownership by Liberian citizens; concessions of more than 100,000 hectares are open for bidding from international investors. Timber sale contracts are established through a bidding process for areas up to 5,000 hectares; bidders must demonstrate at least 51% ownership by Liberian citizens. Private Use Permits are licenses issued to private landowners to extract wood and lack sustainability regulations. Global Witness compiled the logging concession data as part of the report <em>Signing Their Lives Away: Liberia’s Private Use Permits and the Destruction of Community Owned Rainforest</em> (Global Witness, 2012).</p>

              <p>This data layer shows the boundaries of agro-industrial zones, where oil palm and rubber tree plantations, as well as other crops, may be established. In Cameroon, industrial agriculture falls outside of the National Forest Estate. Agricultural plantations are allocated by the Ministry of Economy and Planning to private entities under long-term, renewable contracts, which are then monitored by the Ministry of Agriculture. The agro-industrial data set was mapped using satellite imagery, with ground-truthing to determine the crop type and operating company. Official documentation was often lacking, so boundaries should be considered approximate and nonexhaustive.</p>

          <p>The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) is the most comprehensive global spatial data set on marine and terrestrial protected areas available. Protected area data are provided via <a href='http://www.protectedplanet.net/' target='_blank'>protectedplanet.net</a>, the online interface for the <a href='http://www.wdpa.org/' target='_blank'>World Database on Protected Areas</a> (WDPA). The WDPA is a joint initiative of the IUCN and UNEP-WCMC to compile spatially referenced information about protected areas.</p>

          <p><strong><a href='http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/gpap_home/gpap_quality/gpap_pacategories/' target='_blank'>IUCN Management Categories</a></strong></p>

          <p>Not all protected areas receive the same degree of protection. While some have strict guidelines designed to preserve intact ecosystems, others allow for sustainable land use, often including limited resource extraction. In addition, not all countries use the same terminology when designating a protected area. Accordingly, the  <a href='http://www.iucn.org/' target='_blank'>International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> defined universal management categories that stipulate the level of protection for most protected areas.</p>

          <p>As you click through protected areas in this layer, note the “legal designation” and the explanations below to better understand the degree to which an area is protected.</p>

          <ul class='bullets'>
            <li><strong>Ia. Strict Nature Reserves.</strong> Protected areas designed to preserve biodiversity and all geological features. Limited human use (e.g., scientific study, education) is allowed and carefully monitored. Strict Nature Reserves are often used to understand the impact of indirect human disturbance (e.g., burning fossil fuels) because of the area’s high level of preservation. <em>Other common designations:</em> Biological Reserve, Botanical Reserve</li>
            <li><strong>Ib. Wilderness Areas.</strong> Protected areas managed to preserve ecosystem processes with limited human use. Wilderness Areas cannot contain modern infrastructure (e.g., a visitor’s center), but they allow for local indigenous groups to maintain subsistence lifestyles. These areas are often established to restore disturbed environments. <em>Other common designations:</em> Wilderness Reserve, Wildlife Area</li>
            <li><strong>II. National Parks.</strong> Protected areas designed to preserve large-scale ecosystems and support human visitation. With conservation as a priority, these areas allow infrastructure and contribute to the local economy by providing opportunities for environmental educational and recreation. <em>Other common designations:</em> State Park, Class A Park, Park Reserve, Provincial Park</li>
            <li><strong>III. National Monuments or Features.</strong> Areas established to protect a specific natural feature (e.g., cave, grove) or human-made monument with significant historical, spiritual, or environmental importance and the immediate surroundings. Accordingly, Natural Monuments or Features are typically smaller in area and have high human impact resulting from visitor traffic. <em>Other common designations:</em> Natural Features Reserve, Nature Monument, Botanical Garden</li>
            <li><strong>IV. Habitat and Species Management Areas.</strong> Areas designed to conserve specific wildlife populations and/or habitats. Habitat and Species Management Areas often exist within a larger ecosystem or protected area and are carefully managed (e.g., through hunting abatement or habitat restoration) to conserve a target species or habitat. <em>Other common designations:</em> National Wildlife Refuge, State Wildlife Management Area, Faunal Reserve, Zakaznik (Russia), Provincial Reserve, Wildlife Sanctuary</li>
            <li><strong>V. Protected Landscapes and Seascapes.</strong> Protected areas with ecological, biological, or cultural importance that have been shaped by human use of the landscape. Protected landscapes and seascapes typically cover entire bodies of land or ocean and allow for a number of for-profit activities (e.g., ecotourism) in accordance with the region’s management plan. <em>Other common designations:</em> National Forest, State Natural Area, Environmental Protection Area, Protected Area, Quasi National Park (Japan), Nature Reserve, State Natural Area</li>
            <li><strong>VI. Protected Areas with Sustainable Use of Natural Resources.</strong> Areas designed to manage natural resources and uphold the livelihoods of surrounding communities. These regions have a low level of human occupation, small-scale developments (i.e., not industrial), and part of the landscape in its natural condition. <em>Other common designations:</em> Wildlife Reserve, Biosphere Reserve, Forest Reserve, Protective Zone, National Forest, Natural and National Reserves, Reserve, Multiple Use Reserve, Municipal Reserve</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class='overview_title'>Overview</h3>
          <p>First defined in 1988 by scientist Norman Myers, biodiversity hotspots are areas characterized by high levels of endemic plants coupled with significant habitat loss. Specifically, a region must meet the following criteria to achieve Conservation International’s hotspot classification:</p>

          <ul class='bullets'>
            <li>At least 1,500 species of vascular plants (>0.5% of the world’s total) are endemic</li>
            <li>At least 70% of the original natural vegetation has been lost</li>
          </ul>

          <p>When Myers first defined the term, he identified 10 tropical forest hotspots. The need to pinpoint priority conservation regions led Conservation International (CI) to adopt the term and reassess the hotspot concept. In this process, CI introduced quantitative thresholds (see above) and added additional regions. At that time, there were 25 hotspots. Because of the constant change in environmental threats and the improved understanding of biodiversity, CI has since revisited the hotspots to refine boundaries, update information, and add new regions. This process produced an additional 10 hotspots, bringing the total to 35.</p>

  <p class='source_category_description'>Data compiled under “People” indicate areas over which indigenous peoples or local communities have rights over land and/or certain resources.</p>

  <p class='source_category_description'>The laws of many countries separate land rights from resource rights. Legally recognized land rights extend to the land and certain resources associated with the land, depending on the nature of the right. The right to the land and certain resources include some combination of rights of access, use, management, exclusion, and alienation. Similarly, legally recognized resource rights can cover some combination of the right to access, use, manage, exclude, or alienate forests, wildlife, or other resources. Whether rights to the land or resources, the law may recognize their rights in perpetuity or for a limited period of time. </p>

  <p class='source_category_description'>Some data sets displayed on Global Forest Watch include land and resource rights governed by customary tenure systems but that are not recognized by national laws.</p>

              <p>A Reserve legally recognizes a tribal group’s perpetual right of access, use, withdrawal, management, and exclusion over land and its associated resources. The land remains officially owned by the British Crown and administered by either the Canadian Federal or Provincial Governments. Alienation of Reserve land is prohibited, except to the British Crown. Reserve land may be allocated to individual members of the tribe by a tribal Council in the form of Certificates of Possession with the approval of the Minister of Indian Affairs. Certificates of Possession entitle a member of the tribe to beneficial use and enjoyment of a specific area in the Reserve, as well as the right to transfer the land through sale, lease, will, or otherwise to other members of the tribe subject to the approval of the Minister of Indian Affairs.</p>

              <p>Native Title is generally the legal recognition of the rights of indigenous groups to land and resources. The specific rights vary depending on whether the area is subject to competing legal rights, such as private ownership or leases, as well as the customary rights exercised over the area. Native title could grant rights of access, use, withdrawal for subsistence, and, in some cases, rights of management and exclusion.</p>

Community Forests legally recognize a community’s ownership rights to forest resources, both timber and non-timber. It includes the right to access, use, withdraw for commercial purposes or subsistence, and exclude others from the forest. The land remains owned by the Cameroonian Government. The community’s rights to forest resources are renewed every five years as long as the community complies with the Community Forest Management Agreement. A community may also contract with a third party to commercially harvest timber</p>

          <p class='first'>This base map depicts the highest points in the forest canopy. Its spatial resolution is 0.6 miles (1 km) and was validated against data from a network of nearly 70 ground sites around the world. It was developed by a team of scientists from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California; the University of Maryland, College Park; and Woods Hole Research Center, Falmouth, Massachusetts. The map was created using 2.5 million carefully screened, globally distributed laser pulse measurements from space. The light detection and ranging (Lidar) data were collected in 2005 by the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System instrument on NASA’s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat).</p>

  <h2 class='source_category_title'>Countries</h2>
  <div class='single-source-item'>
    <p>Data provided on the <%= link_to 'country pages', countries_path %> come from a range of sources. Read below to learn more about each.</p>

    <h3 class='overview_title'>Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)</h3>
    <p>Many figures on the country pages come from the FAO’s Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA). As stated on the <a href='http://www.fao.org/forestry/fra/fra2010/en/' target='_blank'>FAO website</a>, the FRA is a comprehensive assessment of forests and forestry that examines the current status and recent trends for different variables covering the extent, condition, uses and values of forests. To create the report, information was collated from 233 countries and territories for four points in time: 1990, 2000, 2005 and 2010. FAO worked closely with countries and specialists in the design and implementation of FRA 2010 - through regular contact, expert consultations, training for national correspondents and ten regional and subregional workshops. More than 900 contributors were involved, including 178 officially nominated national correspondents and their teams. To learn more, visit the <a href='http://www.fao.org/forestry/fra/fra2010/en/' target='_blank'>FAO website</a> or <a href='http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/i3110e/i3110e.pdf' target='_blank'>download the full report</a>.</p>

    <p>The country pages also present data from <a href='http://faostat.fao.org/' target='_blank'>FAOSTAT</a>, FAO’s platform for data collection and dissemination. According to FAO, the FAOSTAT <a href='http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/download/G2/*/E' target='_blank'>Emissions Land Use database</a> provides country-level estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on FAOSTAT activity data using Tier 1 computations, following 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National GHG Inventories. Changes in carbon stocks and ecosystem function linked to anthropogenic activities such as land-use change and land management determine emissions and removals of GHG that are reported by countries for the IPCC Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) categories. To learn more, visit the <a href='http://faostat.fao.org/' target='_blank'>FAOSTAT website</a>.</p>

    <p>Data on the economic value and employment in national forestry sectors are reported from “Contribution of the forestry sector to national economies, 1990-2006” by A. Lebedys. Forest Finance Working Paper FSFM/ACC/08. FAO, Rome. To learn more, <a href='ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/011/k4588e/k4588e00.pdf' target='_blank'>download the full report</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Figures:</strong> type of forest, economic value of the forestry sector, employment, carbon stocks, emissions</p>

    <h3 class='overview_title'>University of Maryland (UMD)</h3>
    <p>Figures for tree cover extent, loss, and gain presented on the country and global overview pages were calculated using tabular data from a 2013 publication, “<a href='http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6160/850' target='_blank'>High-Resolution Global Maps of 21st-Century Forest Cover Change</a>" by Hansen <em>et al</em>.</p>

    <h3 class='overview_title'>European Space Agency (GlobCover)</h3>
    <p>Data from the European Space Agency’s GlobCover was used to visualize tree cover extent on the country pages. As stated on the <a href='http://due.esrin.esa.int/globcover/' target='_blank'>ESA website</a>, GlobCover is an initiative which began in 2005 in partnership with a number of organizations. The aim of the project was to develop a service capable of delivering global composites and land cover maps using input observations from the 300m MERIS sensor on board the ENVISAT satellite mission. ESA makes available the land cover maps, which cover 2 periods: December 2004 - June 2006 and January - December 2009. To learn more, visit the <a href='http://due.esrin.esa.int/globcover/' target='_blank'>GlobCover website</a> or <a href='http://due.esrin.esa.int/globcover/LandCover2009/Globcover2009_V2.3_Global_.zip' target='_blank'>download the 2009 GlobCover map</a>.</p>

    <h3 class='overview_title'>The Rights and Resources Initiative (RRI)</h3>
    <p>Figures on forest tenure come from the Rights and Resource Initiative and are based on data adapted from the <a href='http://www.rightsandresources.org/documents/index.php?pubID=1075' target='_blank'>Tropical Forest Tenure Assessment</a>. The goal of the report is to present and analyze the state of forest tenure in much of the world’s tropical forests. As stated on <a href='http://www.rightsandresources.org/programs.php?id=237' target='_blank'>RRI's website</a>, the tenure systems represented by this data is sourced from governments, and therefore only reflects those systems of natural resource management that are legally recognized by those governments. Such officially outlined tenure systems fall under the category of statutory tenure regimes within these studies. The official data often presents an incomplete picture of the institutions that actually manage natural resources, particularly at a local level. To learn more, visit the <a href='http://www.rightsandresources.org/programs.php?id=237' target='_blank'>RRI forest tenure page</a>.</p>
